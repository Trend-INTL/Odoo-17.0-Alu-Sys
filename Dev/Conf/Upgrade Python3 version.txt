Install Python 3.10

Follow the simple steps to install and configure Python 3.10

Step 1: Add the repository and update
Latest Python 3.10 is not available in Ubuntuâ€™s default repositories. So, we have to add an additional repository. On launchpad repository named deadsnakes is available for Python Packages.

Add the deadsnakes repository using the below commands.

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt-get update
Update the package list using the below command.

sudo apt-get update
Verify the updated Python packages list using this command.

sudo apt list | grep python3.10
As seen in the image above, Now we have Python 3.10 available for installation.


Step 2: Install the Python 3.10 package using apt-get
install Python 3.10 by using the below command :

sudo apt-get install python3.10
Step 3: Add Python 3.8 & Python 3.10 to update-alternatives
Add both old and new versions of Python to Update Alternatives.

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.8 1
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.10 2
Step 4: Update Python 3 for point to Python 3.10
By default, Python 3 is pointed to Python 3.8. That means when we run python3 it will execute as python3.8 but we want to execute this as python3.10.

Type this command to configure python3:

sudo update-alternatives --config python3
You should get the above output. Now type 2 and hit enter for Python 3.10. Remember the selected number may differ so choose the selection number which is for Python 3.10.


Step 5: Test the version of python
Finally, test the current version of python by typing this :

python3 -V
You should get Python 3.10 as output.

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt-get update
And then installed the distutils package for Python 3.7:

sudo apt install python3.7-distutils
Note: for some reason I had an error installing the latter, that I solved this way:

sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/python3.7-distutils_3.7.9-1+focal1_all.deb
sudo apt-get -f install
